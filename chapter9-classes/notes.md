In object-oriented programming you write **classes** that represent real-world things and situations, and you create **objects** based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.  
Making an object from a class is called **instantiation**, and you work with **instances** of a class.  
By convention, capitalized names refer to classes in Python. eg.Dog  
Write doctring for each class you define.  
The \__init__() method is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the class.  
The self parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come first before the other parameters.

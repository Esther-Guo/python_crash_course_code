Think of variables as labels that you can assign to values.  
**strip()** removes extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a string.  
Group digits using underscores to make large numbers more readable.When you print a number that was defined using underscores, Python prints only the digits. 14_000_000  
Python programmers use **all capital letters** to indicate a variable should be treated as a
constant and never be changed.

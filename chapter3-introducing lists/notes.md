A list is a collection of items in a particular order.  
Itâ€™s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names, since a list usually contains more than one element.  
Add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method. eg.motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')  
If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list(and never use it), you can use the del statement. eg.del motorcycles[0]  
The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it. pop(index) allows you to remove an element in any particular position.  
If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the
remove() method.
